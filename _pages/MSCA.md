# Marie Skłodowska-Curie project D-FINED

From 1 February 2020 to 31 January 2022 I was a Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellow at the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) of the University of Oxford. My project D-FINED was funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 837724.

<b>Project synopsis</b>

<b>Finite model theory</b> is the specialisation of model theory to finite structures, and has been called _"the logic of computer science"_ since in the latter field the basic models of computation are finite. Many classical results of model theory, such as the compactness theorem, fail when restricted to finite models. For this reason, finite model theory has developed independently from model theory and the research communities, as well as the techniques, are almost disjoint. Finite model theory exemplifies a strand in the field of logic in computer science focussing on <b>expressiveness and complexity</b> (<em>Power</em>), as opposed to the one focussing on <b>semantics and compositionality</b> (<em>Structure</em>). The project D-FINED (<u>D</u>uality for <u>fin</u>it<u>e</u> mo<u>d</u>els) aims to apply duality theory and categorical tools to bridge the gap between the semantics methods of model theory, and the combinatorial and complexity-theoretic methods of finite model theory, i.e., to relate <em>Structure</em> and <em>Power</em>.

The three main goals in this direction are to:

<ol>
  <li> Develop a structural approach to the study of spaces of finite structures, based on duality and categorical methods. </li>
  <li> Extend the applicability of these methods from finite structures to tame classes of infinite structures. </li>
  <li> Relate the duality approach to existing categorical semantics, such as Lawvere's hyperdoctrines and the game comonads recently introduced by Abramsky, Dawar and their collaborators. </li>
</ol>

This project may contribute to a more unified view of logic in mathematics and computer science, providing new tools for a structural approach to more algorithmic and complexity-oriented areas of logic such as finite model theory.
